            <div class="answers" id="answer3">
                <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
                <p>Submit a total of twenty still images and/or moving image files that represent your strongest work. When presenting book-related designs, show a cover and one representative spread in a single image file, at maximum. Alternatively, a short video showing a few spreads may be prepared. For websites, show just one still web page per image file, or prepare a short video showing three to four frames being clicked or scrolled. A complex, systems-related project should be edited to two or three of the strongest components. Three-dimensional works should show the surrounding space and context. Limit the use of detail images to situations where they are considered absolutely necessary. When presenting both still and moving images, please present them in two groups, with all still images followed by all moving images. Within these groups, place files in chronological order starting with the oldest and ending with the most recent work.</p>
                <h4>Painting/Printmaking</h4>
                <p> Submit sixteen still images and/or moving image files that represent your strongest work, ideally completed within the last two years. We recommend selecting work made in the last twelve months for at least half the total portfolio selections. The admissions committee is concerned with scale and the tactility of the work; as such, paintings and drawings should be photographed showing the edge of the work (do not digitally crop the file or mask in black to the edges of the work). Documentation of three-dimensional works should consider the surrounding space and context. Image details should only be included if considered necessary. </p>
                <h4>Photography</h4>
                <p>Submit a total of twenty still images and/or moving image files that represent your strongest work and indicate subject matter(s) of interest. We recommend selecting work made in the last twelve months for at least half the total portfolio selections. Indicate the photographic format used to make your pictures. If you are presenting both still and moving images, group still images first, followed by time-based files.</p>
                <h4>Sculpture</h4>
                <p>Submit a total of twenty examples of work, ideally completed within the last two years. We recommend selecting work made in the last twelve months for at least half the portfolio selections. The admissions committee is concerned with scale and the tactility of the work, as well as fabrication techniques. Documentation of three-dimensional works should consider the surrounding space and context. Detail photos of works may be included if considered necessary; limit to no more than two details. If you are presenting both still and moving images, group still images first, followed by time-based files.</p>

                <p>Financial aid is available in a combination of work-study, education loans, and scholarship to assist students in financing their education. In conformity with university policy, financial assistance is determined only after a student has been accepted for admission and is awarded solely on the basis of demonstrated financial need and available resources within the Yale School of Art. The school determines financial need in accordance with formulas established by federal and institutional methodologies. At present, more than 80 percent of students in the School receive some form of financial aid. There are no scholarships based on merit or any criteria other than financial need. </p>
