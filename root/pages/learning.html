            <h2>Four Pillars</h2>
            <p>The primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own studio activity. Students are also offered support for <strong>careers/internships</strong>. These experiences provide excellent networking opportunities.</p>
            <p>Complementing this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured <strong>courses</strong> such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale.</p>
            <p>Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members and visitors. Faculty and students also engage in many kinds of <strong>interdisciplinary collaborations</strong>, such as those with the Yale School of the Environment.</p>
            <p>Building on a long history of social engagement through art is the are the global initiatives offered through the <strong>Art in the World program</strong>. This offers opportunities for inspiring creative cultural exchanges.</p>

                <p>The fruit of an interdisciplinary collaboration is now a touring multimedia art exhibition.</p>
                <p>Spearheaded by Yale School of Art faculty member Sasha Baker-Jones and MFA student Harris Sutherton, Forest Reflections promotes awareness of the multifaceted impacts of climate change on trees globally, and the ways it affects wildlife and agriculture.</p>
                <p>Paintings, photographs, sculptures and digital media depict the effects of drought, fire, floods, insects and disease, as well as trees’ resilience and adaptability.</p>
