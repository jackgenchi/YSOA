                    <p class="bulletinDescription">The Law, Ethics &amp; Animals Program at Yale Law School
                        (law.yale.edu/animals) is inviting applications for its 2024-25 LEAP Student Fellows Program.
                        Applications are due on Wednesday, September 25.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>About LEAP:</strong><br>
                        Launched in 2019, the Law, Ethics &amp; Animals Program (LEAP) at Yale Law School is a
                        multidisciplinary “think-and-do tank” dedicated to developing new strategies to address
                        industrialized animal cruelty and its impacts on the living world, and to drawing attention to
                        the questions of conscience and law raised by humanity's treatment of animals. To this end, LEAP
                        leads and coordinates a diverse program of activities that serve students and scholars at Yale
                        and that contribute to defining, expanding, and advancing the field of animal law and policy.
                        LEAP's programming includes academic and experiential courses; the Climate Change and Animal
                        Agriculture Litigation Initiative and other research initiatives; active support for student
                        research projects and publications; and regular lectures, panels, and events. Learn more at our
                        website: law.yale.edu/animals.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>About the LEAP Student Fellows Program:</strong><br>
                        Each academic year, LEAP selects a group of Student Fellows, including both Yale Law School
                        students and other Yale graduate and professional school students. The goal of the Student
                        Fellows Program is to support the academic and professional goals of Yale students interested in
                        helping animals, to further empower these students to do impactful work while at Yale, and to
                        build a robust and fun community of students and scholars interested in animal law and policy on
                        campus.
                        <br><br>
                        During the academic year, LEAP Student Fellows receive support from LEAP faculty and staff to
                        work on a project related to animal law, policy, and ethics. The projects can take a myriad of
                        forms, such as academic research (either with LEAP or independently); a policy proposal;
                        submission of comments on proposed regulations; an op-ed or popular press article; or another
                        research or creative project of the Fellow's choosing. Credit or pay is available for some
                        projects. LEAP Fellows shape and participate in the life of the LEAP program in a variety of
                        ways, including helping to envision, organize, and advertise the events that LEAP hosts during
                        the academic year. LEAP Fellows are asked, at minimum, to work on one project of their own
                        choosing, to attend two LEAP events per semester, and to help spread the word about LEAP events
                        and initiatives on campus.
                        <br><br>
                        We welcome applications from all Yale graduate and professional school students. No past
                        experience or expertise in animal law is necessary.

                        <strong>Open Call for Hypertext/Hyperlink Exhibition, CCAM ISOVIST Gallery, Fall 2024:</strong>
                        Hypertext has
                        been a foundational concept in how the web operates, connecting relational pages through
                        hyperlinks to create a constellation of interconnected documents. The term “hypertext” was
                        coined by Theodor Nelson, who described it as “non-sequential writing - text that branches and
                        allows choices to the reader.” This concept is evident in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the
                        markup language used for creating websites, where the anchor tag links HTML documents together.
                        Curated by CCAM ISOVIST Guest Curator Alvin Ashiatey (Lecturer, Yale School of Art and MFA '22)

                        <h3>Call for Participation: Yale Textile Working Group</h3>
                        <p class="bulletinDescription">This fall marks the beginning of a new interdisciplinary working
                            group centered around textiles, sponsored by the Whitney Humanities Center. The group is
                            intended to help Yale community members connect over the topic of textiles. Researchers,
                            historians, makers and practitioners of all disciplines and expertise levels are all
                            welcome!
                            <br><br>
                            Meetings will serve as spaces to discuss the history and future of textile crafts in all
                            dimensions, including techniques (weaving, embroidery, quilting, knitting, crochet, etc.),
                            materials (cotton, silk, wool, synthetics, dyes, etc.), and practices (social histories,
                            collectives, industries, sciences, local traditions, etc.) While the group can be called a
                            working group in an academic sense, it is also intended in a more tangible sense: if you
                            have
                            handwork that you want to attend to in a communal setting, you are welcome to bring along
                            works
                            in progress. Working in community facilitates an alternative discussion space to the
                            traditional
                            academic forum, and some limited basic materials and tools will be supplied at meetings.
                            <br><br>
                            Depending on interest, members will also be welcomed to join in on the Yale Farm's indigo
                            harvest and dye extraction process, which will occur until the first frost, and a mending
                            workshop is also planned for the fall. <strong>To join the email list to be notified of
                                meetings and

                    <h3>Yale Ventures x CCAM Curatorial Fellowship</h3>
                    <p class="bulletinDescription">Yale Ventures, launched by Yale University in 2022, was created to
                        connect and support the university's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. We seek to build
                        a vibrant entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem that increases support, resources, and
                        opportunities for Yale innovators—faculty and students—as they translate their ideas and
                        discoveries into new ventures that will positively impact the world's greatest challenges. Yale
                        Ventures will open their new space at 101 College Street in October 2024. This
                        10,000-square-foot space will include flexible space for mission-related programming, as well as
                        office spaces and conference rooms for Yale staff engaged in related projects.
                        <br><br>
                        The Yale Ventures x Yale CCAM Art + Innovation Fellowship offers a unique opportunity to
                        activate the Yale Ventures headquarters by curating art that embodies Yale's vibrant
                        interdisciplinary community. This fellowship is designed for a Yale artist, technologist, and/or
                        curator from any media and practice(s) or discipline who is passionate about the intersection of
                        innovation and technology at the university.
                        <br><br>
                        The fellow will curate one or more works from among the Yale community and/or in the greater art
                        world to inspire and engage visitors and community members in the space, leveraging these
                        themes. The fellow will consult with the Yale Ventures and Yale CCAM teams to receive guidance
                        on the creative and logistical aspects of the exhibition, with the goal of imagining new methods
                        and augmenting existing practices of curatorial expression and engagement. The works, subject to
                        approval by Yale Ventures and CCAM, will be displayed at the Yale Ventures headquarters at 101
                        College Street, timed to coincide with the opening of the new space.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to activating the Yale Ventures space, fellows will support Yale CCAM in the
                        production of its Fall 2024 exhibition at its ISOVIST gallery, which opens on November 8, 2024.
                        This may involve assisting the show curator with the installation of artworks, publications, and
                        other duties as assigned.

                        principles and techniques that can help you make compelling data visualizations that effectively
                        convey your work to viewers. Participants will walk away with a conceptual grounding in
                        designing data visualizations; this workshop will not focus on conveying statistical
                        significance or adhering to disciplinary standards in traditional data fields. No programming
                        experience required.

                        meaningful and ethical DH projects by critically discussing case studies of existing projects as
                        a group. We'll also discuss the history of DH as a field and practice while collaboratively
                        creating vocabularies around what it even means to “do DH”— especially what it means to “do good
                        DH” —and identifying important questions to ask along the way.
                        <br><br>
                        Participants will work together to identify qualities essential to any effective DH project and
                        will walk away with a shared vocabulary to critique and propose DH projects of their own. This
                        workshop will involve a lot of working together, but we do not expect participants to bring
                        existing knowledge of DH methods, programming, or technical skills in general.
                        <br><br>
                        Note: This workshop is open to current Yale graduate students and postdocs and is the first
                        requirement to complete the Digital Humanities Lab's DH certificate. Participants must attend
                        all three parts to receive credit.

                    <h3>University of New Haven seeks collaborators on interdisciplinary poetry project</h3>
                    <p class="bulletinDescription">The University of New Haven invites student artists specializing in
                        painting and graphic illustration to participate in an exciting interdisciplinary project that
                        merges the worlds of poetry and visual art. This unique initiative, led by fellow UNH instructor
                        and award-winning poet, Lauren Crawford, centers around her debut poetry collection, which
                        explores profound themes through vivid language and compelling narratives. The project seeks to
                        bring these poems to life through original artworks created by talented visual artists, offering
                        a powerful dialogue between word and image.
                        <br><br>
                        Participating artists will be tasked with interpreting and creating a visual piece inspired by
                        one of the poems from Lauren's forthcoming collection, which will be featured in a virtual
                        gallery on her author's website as well as promotional material & potential live exhibitions.
                        This project not only provides a unique platform for artists to showcase their work alongside a
                        published poetry collection but also introduces a philanthropic element: in exchange for student
                        artwork, Lauren will make donations to charities chosen by the contributing artists. This
                        approach fosters both artistic collaboration and community impact, providing artists with a
                        meaningful opportunity to express their creativity while supporting causes they care about.
                        <br><br>
                        This is a fantastic chance for student artists to gain exposure, collaborate across mediums, and
                        be part of a project that bridges literature and visual art in a fresh and impactful way.
                        Students who identify as women, LGBTQ, and Persons of Color/Indigenous are especially welcome to
                        apply. Deadline for completed pieces is <strong>November 15, 2024</strong>. Interested students
                        are encouraged to

                    <p class="bulletinDescription">The PERIPLUS project is founded as a nonprofit organization to reveal
                        and diffuse creativity's power for the common good. Provoking change and positively affecting
                        the present and future of individuals, social groups, businesses and institutions, through
                        innovatively enhancing pre-existing potential and fostering local community regenerative
                        motivation.
                        <br><br>
                        The 2025 residencies' program, Periplus* Workshops, offers the unique opportunity for emerging
                        creatives to respond to nature in two small villages of rural Greece. In Arcadia, the mythical
                        land of pastoral utopia, in central Peloponnese or at the agricultural side of the historical
                        Chania Region, in Crete. In a carefully structured period of intensive days, a determined group
                        of participants use limited resources to create individual and collaborative responses,
                        culminating in a local exhibition which is open to the wider local community and encourages an
                        outward-facing conversation about the value of experimental creativity in context.
                        <br><br>
                        As well as learning from and working alongside local people, participants in Periplus Workshops
                        foster sustainable development through skillsharing, introducing new approaches to problem
                        solving and storytelling. At the same time, learning about the traditional forms of handicrafts
                        and local material culture, they are looking for new ways of better preserving and innovatively
                        including them. They take active part into giving the selected territories visibility as a
                        living laboratory, open to new thinking capable of playing a key role in changing the social
                        fabric and bring about new ways of doing and being.

            <h2>Join the all-school design call list</h2>
            <p class="description">The School of Art's Communications Office is assembling our annual list of students
                interested in being placed on a call list to receive opportunities for small one-time design jobs and to
                produce email publication graphics. These one-time jobs are open to MFA students in all areas of study,
                and graphics can take any form as long as the requirements laid out in each job description are met.</p>
