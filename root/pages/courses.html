            <h2>Courses</h2>
            <p>Courses numbered 001 through 099 are offered only to first-year Yale College students. Courses numbered
                110 through 499 are studio electives offered to students from Yale College, the graduate school, and the
                professional schools. Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment in all courses. Graduate
                students of the School of Art who wish to broaden their experience outside their area of concentration
                have priority in enrollment.
                <br><br>
                Courses numbered 500 and above are offered only to graduate students of the School of Art, the graduate
                school, and the professional schools. Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment in all
                courses. In exceptional cases, qualified Yale College students may enroll in a graduate course with the
                permission of both the instructor and the director of undergraduate studies. Please refer to the section
                on Academic Regulations for further pertinent details. Faculty members teach on both the graduate and
                undergraduate levels, although the degree and the nature of contact may vary.
                <br><br>
                Tutorials, which are special courses that cannot be obtained through regular class content, require a
                proposal written by the student and the faculty member concerned, defining both content and
                requirements. Proposals must be presented to the Academic Subcommittee for approval.

                            focusing on graphic design. Our animating question throughout the term is: “can graphic design
                            be understood as a form of activism or protest?” Looking to histories of graphic innovation
                            linked to diverse social interests (among them, Black power, women’s liberation, queer activism,
                            environmentalism, the antiwar movement, independence movements, etc.), we will study the ways in
                            which collective practices fashion the image of a culture in times of pronounced political
                            change: as a vehement challenge to the dominance of official media and a critical form of
                            self-representation. One goal is to consider the implications of such work in the present, a
                            moment in which corporate media, misinformation campaigns, and algorithmic capitalism has
                            exerted decisive control over public discourse. </td>

Students explore the implementation of technologies in their art making from pneumatic kinetics, bioengineering, AR, VR, and works assisted by artificial intelligence—modes of production that carry movement, degradation, and displacement of authorship. The student practice is supported by readings, independent research, and essays on diverse artists and designers who make use of technology in their work or, on the contrary, totally avoid it.

                        <td>Much of the field of design concerns itself with devising systems in an attempt to create aesthetic coherence and reduce creative uncertainties, seeking efficiencies with respect to time, production and materials. However this strategy always comes up against each individual set of circumstances; the materials and content at hand, a particular cast of collaborators, a given timeframe. There is an element of the ad hoc in every piece of design; a need to improvise, interpret, adapt, make exceptions. A second thematic concern of this class is the exploration of medium-specificity and medium-porosity as they relate to such systems. The course is comprised of a series of interconnected prompts across distinct formats in print, motion, and interactive, at a wide variety of scales. A third and final thread is the cultivation of greater awareness of the evolving social and aesthetic functions of design processes, artifacts, and channels of engagement and distribution, within increasingly complex cultural contexts.

Students create their own digital typefaces, working on individual projects chosen in consultation with the main instructor. The project definition necessarily includes aesthetic as well as functional goals; with the problems of type design so deeply interconnected, a clear project definition is needed to establish relevant criteria for testing and evaluating the work.</td>
