                        Spotlight Series at the
                        Yale School of Art, is pleased to present Image as Critique. This symposium brings together a
                        distinguished panel of artists and thinkers—Karl Haendel (panelist), Latipa (panelist), Naeem
                        Mohaiemen (panelist), Paul Pfeiffer (panelist and keynote speaker), and John Yau(moderator)—to
                        explore and discuss the role of critique in contemporary art and life. The discussion will
                        examine how a critical attitude challenges conventional ways of engaging with the world and
                        reshapes established notions of power and identity. Additionally, the symposium will explore the
                        formal relationship between critique and representation, focusing on how critique functions as
                        both a speculative and precise tool in art making. Rather than offering narrow definitions, this
                        gathering aims to uncover how critique propels us forward through various conceptual, material,
                        and cultural modes of expression.

                        The Yale School of Art's DEI Spotlight series brings together world renowned, courageous
                        artists, with academic arts communities to showcase their commitment to diverse matters that
                        impact our world.

                        About the artists:
                        <br><br>
                        Paul Pfeiffer
                        Paul Pfeiffer (b. 1966, Honolulu, Hawaii) is an artist living and working in New York City, who
                        has been making work in video, photography, installation, and sculpture since the late 1990s.
                        Known for his innovative manipulation of digital media, Pfeiffer recasts the visual language of
                        mass media spectacle to examine how images shape our awareness of ourselves and the world.
                        Sampling footage from YouTube and other sources, he uses these to plumb the depths of
                        contemporary culture, assessing its racial, religious, and technological dimensions. At the same
                        time, Pfeiffer's objects and images function diachronically, establishing profound genealogies
                        that connect contemporary culture and its many particularities to the long, seemingly remote
                        histories of art, media, religion, and human consciousness.
                        <br><br>
                        Pfeiffer has had many one-person exhibitions at Whitney Museum of American Art (2001); the
                        Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (2003 and 2017-18); the National Gallery of Victoria,
                        Melbourne (2005); MUSAC León, Spain (2008); Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (2009); Sammlung Goetz,
                        Munich (2011); Museum of Contemporary Art and Design, Manila (2015); Inhotim, Brumadinho, Brazil
                        (2018); and The Athenaeum, Athens, GA (2023). He has presented work in major international
                        exhibitions, most recently the Performa Biennial and the Honolulu Biennial in 2019 and the
                        Toronto Biennial and Seoul Mediacity Biennale in 2022. His work is in the permanent collections
                        of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Museum of Modern
                        Art, San Francisco; M+, Hong Kong; The Guggenheim; Tate Modern; and the Pinault Collection,
                        among many others.
                        <br><br>
                        Pfeiffer's first large-scale retrospective of his work at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los
                        Angeles (2023-24) will travel to the Guggenheim Bilbao and open November, 2024.

                        Resistance Laboratory (MEM-RES) a collective initiative to generate living archives of memory

                        publish books that shatter and differently envision the bounds of form, feeling, concept, and
                        politics. For the past twenty-five years Latipa has developed large-scale media installations,
                        experimental documentary films, artist's books, expanded cinema performances, undisciplined
                        writing, and intergenerational popular education initiatives.

                    <p class="eventDescription">Robert Andy Coombs is a queer, disabled photographer. He grew up in
                        Michigan's majestic Upper Peninsula, where he spent his childhood roaming the great outdoors. He
                        started photographing his walkabouts in middle school, and moved on to portraiture in high
                        school. Coombs received a scholarship to Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids
                        Michigan. During his third year in undergrad, he sustained a spinal cord injury due to a
                        gymnastics training accident. After a year of recovery, he returned to KCAD and received his BFA
                        in photography in 2013. Coombs' photography explores the intersections of disability and
                        sexuality. Themes of relationships, caregiving, fetish, and sex are depicted throughout his most
                        prominent series, CripFag. Coombs graduated from the Yale School of Art with his MFA in 2020
                        amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and is currently residing in coastal Alabama.
